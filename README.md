# Federated Learning in flwr-python for imbalanced data

A simplistic architecture for federated learning based on federate averaging in feed-forward neural networks for an imbalanced dataset.

Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/601/ai4i+2020+predictive+maintenance+dataset

To start the learning process, start the server (in terminal):
```python server\server.py```

And each client in separate terminal:
```python client#\client#.py```
